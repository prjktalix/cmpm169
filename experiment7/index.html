				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>We have discussed various creative image ideas for this assignment. With that in mind, we thought about creating a scatter plot with data as our starting point. We also considered using the top 100 anime on MyAnimeList as our main dataset for plotting.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>	We decided to create a force-directed graph to visualize the anime data. We designed each node, representing an anime, to repel each other to avoid overlap. Additionally, we added an interactive hover feature that displays the details of each node. We created a node class to encapsulate the information of each anime. Also, we added color intensity based on the popularity of the anime. The image below shows us interacting with a node, with details visible.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>In this part, we decided to create a visual effect where nodes are linked by lines when they are close to each other. This works by checking the distance between the nodes and drawing a line when they are within range.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Brian - This is a collaborative work between Jose and me. I primarily focused on the integration part, where I added the nodes and attempted to create a force-directed graph. The process was very interesting, 
					as I mostly had to create a class to encapsulate the anime nodes. I am very proud of how the script turned out. It is a complicated script that happens to work well. The challenge was the class encapsulation, 
					while the highlight was implementing the hover feature for the nodes because it was very straightforward.
