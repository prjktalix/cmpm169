				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>As somebody living in the Bay Area who has run a marathon and a marathon in San Francisco, I think the Golden Gate Bridge is one of the memorable parts of the run. I would remember how cold, windy, painful, and hilly it was, but running this part of the race was fun and memorable. I may have little general coding expertise, but imitating the Golden Gate Bridge could be simple. The images shown are the pictures I have taken running at Golden Gate Bridge.</p>

				<p>I want to add seas, clouds, and bridges to my vision. First, I want to create a cloud class to instantiate multiple objects. I found this cloud function in the p5.js documentation. The link is <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/mena-landry/sketches/D7ql4Nd3V">here</a></p>

				<p>I started by adding water to the script. I don't need the land and waves from the water script, which gives me the output above. The water level is more than half of what the canvas covers.</p>

				<p>By changing its map’s height, I was able to fix my concern but lost the waves of the water. But overall, I believe making this change could be more efficient when I started working on innovation.</p>

				<p>The above picture is creating clouds. I have to change my background to red to make the clouds visible. I will change it to an orange or yellowish color to give a bit of golden hour vibes.</p>

				<p>I commented on the cloud script to focus on working on my bridge. The cables would be a tougher part to implement. Before that, I need to readjust the sea height.</p>

				<p>I added multiple rectangular objects to build the bridge's base and the arc that serves as the cables of the bridges. I’m looking for ways to make the cable visible, and I looked at some references on p5.js reference and found out what noFill() can do.</p>
				<img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/415746422_1405934023342669_7007896212503319673_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8cd0a2&_nc_ohc=drr8aDIFz4EAX8emOir&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=03_AdR0gPruhx3TvEBSqmJYcDPZKBTTS36D15pHJPS_El4POA&oe=65DA9E46">
				<p>The picture above is the improved version of the bridge where I removed the fill of the arc and added the stroke and thickness of the stroke of the arc. There was something wrong with the script where the waves of the water stroke are now visible. I may leave it as it is for now and return to it during cleanup.</p>

				<p>The above picture included multiple lines with proper X and Y coordinates to make this look perfect. It may be tedious and annoying, but I did all my calculations worth the result.</p>

				<p>I can’t think of anything when it comes to creativity. I tried adding clouds by pressing the mouse, like in the image above. But it doesn’t inspire me, nor do I think of it as something creative. So, I played around to see what I could do or feel was creative. </p>

				<p>The time I changed the height of my vertex to 0, something came to my mind. I can make it centered, do something with my noise wave, and attempt something similar to what Sryhee Pezla did from Sample Experiment 2, which was given to the class.</p>

				<p>I added the background in the setup function and a random blue color. It’s not the same as what Sryhee did in their work, as I want something more in-depth on the static waves. I tried a lot of different attempts to make it work but failed to do so. I also use the millis function to help time how fast my color waves change per second. Then, I think about how to make it more meaningful.</p>

				<p>I want my piece to be more personal, and clouds can answer it. I did it in a way that I split it in half where the top can overlap while the bottom can’t. I found a reference of no overlap by slow_izzm from p5.js and used it in my cloud at the bottom of my work. I made this part a bit personal as it shows two sides of the story. Running the SF marathon is brutal, especially at the Golden Gate Bridge. The top part represents my high energy and cheerfulness when running through the crowds and the race itself. But of course, sometimes I feel sluggish, energy-depleted, and have countless doubts. But the no overlap function served as a way to show I couldn’t make any more mistakes and that I needed to focus on finishing the race.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this by myself, and it is exciting for me to understand and get used to p5.js. It’s been a while since I’ve used JavaScript, so I was initially rusty. I used multiple sources from the example given from p5.js, such as clouds and noises, and it is a good foundation for me to get used to it once again. There is some learning curve when trying it out, but I mainly play around with the code, and I was very proud that I could build a Golden Gate bridge with rectangles, lines, and arcs. The highs I feel I made were creating my cloud and filling it with random colors. Setting up a normal Golden Gate Bridge with the noise of a water wave feels natural, but I know I need to be more creative and break away from the traditional art. That’s where the lows came in. I took a while to figure out how to make my art more interesting. I couldn’t get my work completed from the noise wave depth. I tried adding += to some of my variables, and all it does is the whole noise going down than the noise itself. I want to make the wave noise go away until it forms a static wave-like on the image on the side. Anyway, I will continue researching how to accomplish that and make it work.</p>
