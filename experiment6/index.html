				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I want to create something in 3D art text where the text is generated dynamically based on the position of the designed text. With that, I started by looking for sample text from the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/P_2_3_3_01">generative design</a> with the image below.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>	I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p09i_hoFdd0&t=1s">YouTube video</a> that demonstrates a script creating a spinning cube in the C language. I want to recreate this spinning cube, but instead of using special symbols, I aim to generate text while the cube is spinning. My main task for this step is integrating this script from C to p5.js. Most of the script is based on calculating the surface area, as well as the X, Y, and Z coordinates.</p>

				<p>I integrated the original script into a p5.js script by setting it up with some array values and the frame rate. In addition, I also have helper functions such as calculateX, calculateY, calculateZ, and calculateForSurface, similar to those from the original script. I added two more cubes to my cube array and used a forEach loop in my draw function.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I combined the spinning cube script with a text-based image script I found during the imitating stage. I replaced the fixed characters for the cube surfaces with characters from inputText. Additionally, I used the greyscale value to determine the character size based on the zBuffer. This method replaces the characters on the surface of the spinning cube, previously special characters, with their desired size determined by the greyscale value.</p>

				<p>	My problem is that the words are jumbled and don't form any coherent text or words from the input text. I modified the way I map text onto the cube's surfaces so that it starts at the same point for each face of the cube.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I experimented further with the spinning cube to enable each word to be visible while pausing, but was unable to achieve this. I realized that as soon as I spun the cube, the text's 
					layout was based on the cube's surface, making it impossible to fix. One idea I considered was replacing the ASCII character with a string, but this led to additional issues. Despite these challenges, 
					I achieved a lot while creating this script, including integrating it with p5.js and making the text work. I undertook this project on my own, which was challenging. By the end of this project, I had learned 
					a great deal about using mathematical calculations with text and grammar.
