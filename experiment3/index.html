				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>	It took me a while to think of something I wanted to create for generative arts. By the end, I had something in mind that I wanted to create. My goal in mind is to merge the morphing shape by sepatolo, and with the wandering point and trail effect from the Random Walk that Wes Modes created from the slides.</p>
				The work of Sepatolo consists of generative that continuously moves and changes shape. You can move around with your mouse cursor. The image can be shown below, and the script is available at this link. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/setapolo/sketches/TgIOmgVFT">click here</a>

				<p>The random walk by Wes Modes consists of perlin noise that selects a random direction and moves a set distance in that direction. The script is available at this link. <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/yfsWrL98k">click here</a></p>

				<p>Overall, the first script creates a morphing shape using points on a circle, while script 2 involves a point wandering around the canvas, and I want to combine them together to see how it would turn out.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>	Most of my script will be based on integrating the two scripts I have chosen from step 1. First, I want to create a trailing effect by introducing the two arrays (xOld, yOld) from the random walk script to store the history of positions for each point. From this, I initialize these arrays to store the positions of the points.</p>>

				<p>	In the draw function, I want to adjust the logic to update the position of each point with random moves while maintaining the trailing history and drawing the trails by connecting previous positions.</p>
				<img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/420589120_347367794807483_81106482700437016_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8cd0a2&_nc_ohc=Wy8pYT1eOtMAX9Tu9lB&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=03_AdTP6U7sXYjgIEUiqI5FX5P61U3FyBYcWj5RI_ZP78qYYA&oe=65DE8F7E">
				<p>From the image above, I added an ellipse to draw the points. It’s found on the top left of my screen. To make the points more accessible to other places, I want to add a user interaction, where I would implement a mousePressed() function where I can reset the shape’s position with a mouse click. Which can both script and image found below</p>
				<img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/420713095_2074783066231203_3832399886919280878_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8cd0a2&_nc_ohc=zAyJ1ReblHEAX9dlFHE&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=03_AdQNWfwgBcSaWUK4LJh677lTWSB2Bj0Jv6mCnGwf3UuwXQ&oe=65DE7AD2">
				<p>I updated my script with random x and y, similar to in random walk, to create a swigly or random drift. In addition, I want to draw my trailing lines by looping the line from the last point to the current point. I also added a stroke from a lighter color and a map function to start the trail brighter and the end of the trail fainter, reading a fading effect as the points move. But for that to happen, I included unshift, which creates a trail effect by keeping track of where the points have moved. You can see the results below.</p>
				<img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/420513509_594129686233538_6675702394640038131_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8cd0a2&_nc_ohc=k0GPC4ljziIAX_8oWVX&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=03_AdTOpTisHOmWQ-p8Up0uYYluX1516Y7KQEMd8Hf_5x-U1A&oe=65DE8077">
				<p>	The output looked and felt small and slow for me, so I want to make some adjustments, such as changing the background for a trailing effect and framerate to make it faster. Also, I deleted the e function from setapolo and added it directly to my setup function to make my script look cleaner. It is hard to see on a screenshot, so I will leave it as it is for now.</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>	It is tough for me to think about what I can do to innovate. I think I just want to make this art some sort of aesthetic reasoning. I added a pop method on the image below because I want to remove the tail once it exceeds the specified length. I want to ensure that the trail only shows the most recent movements. The result shows the trail after leaving in a minute. Compared to the image above, you can see that the oldest position got popped.</p>
				<img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/418731829_326072107099329_7963358234964520982_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=8cd0a2&_nc_ohc=zJ2iKdYrxg8AX-jEOYj&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=03_AdQdPmwWmquT0yiXKFRO5sGIs-YH33JFherNn5b9qejU1Q&oe=65DE8AF9">
				<p>I also changed the background color from 255 to 0 at my setup function to leave any trails when I moved my circle. I also changed the color of my line by adding HSB color mode and color variation. Lastly, I added a dynamic radius based on my mouse position. As you can see in the last picture, the line radius is much bigger if your mouse is away from your keyboard.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>	I worked on this project by myself. Working on this project is an exciting experience. There are a lot of concepts to think of. I am very proud to use such methods as pop and unshift to make a trail. I am slowly getting used to learning how to use JavaScript. Having no constraints or limitations helps me create what I want. There’s no such thing as a grading script that limits what I want to make this happen. My highs are during my innovative part. It is pretty straightforward from what I did to make this work. I only have to add a pop function to leave no trail behind, adding color hues and dynamic radius for mouse movement. My low is integrating two scripts during integration. I had to search on greeks4geeks, chatGPT, and other resources on how to create a trail, and I found out the stroke, and the unshift to make it happen. Overall, I am satisfied with the work I’ve done.</p>
